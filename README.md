React JS Learning Repository

This repository contains the code and documentation for my learning journey with React JS. I have focused on learning various aspects of React JS, including creating components, working with props, and organizing files for each component and element.


React JS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render components when the underlying data changes. In this learning repository, I have focused on the following key areas of React JS:

Creating components: React JS encourages a modular approach to UI development, where the user interface is divided into reusable components. I have learned how to create functional and class components, manage component state, and compose components to build complex UI structures.

Props: React JS uses props (short for properties) to pass data from parent components to child components. I have explored how to define and use props in my components, allowing for dynamic and flexible rendering of UI elements.

File Organization: As the complexity of a React JS project grows, it becomes essential to organize files and components effectively. I have learned about different strategies for organizing files, such as the component-based approach, where each component is placed in its own file, promoting reusability and maintainability.
